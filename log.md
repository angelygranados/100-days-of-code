# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 02, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I learned data types in JavaScript, how to assign variables and its rules of naming, and how to assign numeric values to a variable.

**Thoughts:** Today's lessons were easy but I struggle with the rules of naming. Maybe the next lessons will be more challenging.

### Day 2: July 3, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about strings, how to concatenate and constructing Strings with Variables. Also learned about arrays, how to access data with index, modify arrays and manipulate arrays.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled to understand how to concatenate strings with variables.

### Day 3: July 24, 2019 Thrusday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
