# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 02, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I learned data types in JavaScript, how to assign variables and its rules of naming, and how to assign numeric values to a variable.

**Thoughts:** Today's lessons were easy but I struggle with the rules of naming. Maybe the next lessons will be more challenging.
